Summary of the Analysis

I analysed the trips records (2014-Q4 trips) based on the following logic:

For each station:
    For each date:
      -  I begin with bikes-stock=capacity (We considered that each midnight, the stock of bikes at each station is fully refreshed to the default capacity)
      -  All trips (both departures and arrivals) are taked in consideration in time order
      -  Each trip that starts from that station reduces stock by 1
      -  Each trip that arrives to that station increases stock by 1
      -  For each date, we save the minimum and maximum of stock
    For this specific station, we get the minimum and maximum of all dates

Result is given to 'result.xlsx' excel file

Conclusion:
I can consider that stations that have reached a negative stock at any time, could be considered for an increase of their capacity in the future (question 1 of test). The lower the number, the biggest the neccessity

Similarly, the stations with high 'minimum' stock in time, can be considered that they have more than enough bike docks (question 2 of test)
